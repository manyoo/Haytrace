1. About Haytrace

Haytrace is a very simple raytracer implemented in Haskell. The current version
of this software is not so much tuned, so it is a little slow. It supports Spheres
only By now. But it can render very beautiful images. Haytrace embeds a very 
simple descriptive language which you can use to describe a scene and run Haytrace 
to render it.

2. Usage

Describe the scene you wanted in the language and save it in a file, then fire up
Haytrace with the file specified and it will be rendered.

2. Syntax and Semantic of the language

There are five primitive directives you can use: Background, Size, Surface, Sphere 
and Light. You can use them as many times as you like but the first two directives,
Background and Size will be ignored except their first appearence.

Background:
      	Background (<Double>,<Double>,<Double>)
specify the background color of the scene. the <Double> stands for floating numbers
you can use. Remember, they range in [0,1].
    Ex. Backgound (0.1,0.3,0.5)

Size:
	Size (<Int>,<Int>)
specify the size(that is, width and height) of the result image. <Int> stands for 
integers.
    Ex. Size (1024,768)

Surface:
	Surface <name> {
		Ambient = <Double>        // these all should be in [0,1]
		Diffuse = <Double>
		Specular = <Double>
		Shininess = <Int>
		Reflection = <Double>
		Transmit = <Double>
		Color = (<Double>,<Double>,<Double>)
		}
describe a surface, <name> is a string that you can use to refer to this surface. All
the terms are optional, if you don't specify it, it will use the default value.

Sphere:
	Sphere <name> {
	       Radius = <Double>                      // these can be any real
	       Center = (<Double>,<Double>,<Double>)  // numbers
	       Surface = <sname>
	       }
describe a sphere, <name> is a string for this sphere which is useless now. <sname> is
the name of the surface you want to use for the sphere, it can be the names of surfaces
you described in the file or use "defaultSurface" (without quote) for the default one.
All the terms are optional, if you don't specify it, it will use the default value.

Light: 
       Light <name> {
       	     Position = (<Double>,<Double>,<Double>)  // any real numbers
	     Intensity = <Double>                     // intensity should be in [0,1]
	     }
describe a light source, <name> is a string for this light which is useless now.

For demostrations of the language, check demo scene files in the demo directory.
